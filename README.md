# Chatbot
Created an AI agent that could make simple responses based on user's question.
The agent can recognize feelings: sadnes, happyness, joy and it derivates within the user's input.
The agent can recognize when user say they are: ok, good and bad within a user's response.
The agent can recognize verbs ending in "ed" and use the verb in its natural form in the response.
The agent must recognize some relationship labels.
